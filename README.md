The backend of the *my-diary* project is built using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB as the database for securely storing user notes and diary entries. It features full CRUD functionality, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete their personal notes. For authentication, the backend uses **jsonwebtoken** to securely identify users and **bcryptjs** for password hashing, ensuring data privacy and security. Validation is handled using **express-validator** to ensure the integrity of the data. The backend is optimized for performance, with API endpoints designed to handle requests efficiently, providing a seamless experience when connected to the frontend.
